# Cat-Dog-Recog
Dog vs. Cat Classification using CNN 🐶🐱
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of dogs and cats. The model is trained on labeled images and predicts whether a given image contains a dog or a cat.

Project Overview
Uses TensorFlow/Keras to build a CNN-based binary classifier.
Model consists of convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.
Uses ReLU activation in hidden layers and sigmoid activation in the output layer.
Trained using binary cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer.
Evaluates performance using accuracy metric.
